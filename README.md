# MultiplexedCalc
## Description
This is a simple project which simulates a basic calculator multiplexedcalc.server based. multiplexedcalc.server.multiplexedcalc.server is constructed as a multiplexed one.
The purpose of this project is to better learn how web common protocols (such as HTTP and so on) are constructed and how actually they work.
It is obviously an academic and learning only project.
## How to use it
To get started, you need to compile and run the multiplexedcalc.server:
```
./serverstart.sh
```
And then, in another terminal, you just need to compile and run the multiplexedcalc.client (if you want to use it with different hosts and networks, you shall change IP Address in the multiplexedcalc.Constants.java file):
```
./clientstart.sh
```
To understand how is the usage you can simply type 'help'.
